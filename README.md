### talbot !
- New to pt, I don't understand everything yet! I'm shy and have autism, have patience. W2I preferred!!
- Mostly lurking or afk, I won't see local chat usually.
- I sit with my bfam when he's online, you can sit with me as long as you're chill!
- No RP please.
- I hide/block liberally. It's not a personal attack or drama, I just currate my experience.
